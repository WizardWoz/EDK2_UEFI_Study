EDK II LIBC Project Maintainers
===============================

This file provides information about the primary maintainers for the EDK II LIBC
Project.  This repository was exported from the edk2 repository and depends
on the edk2 repository.  The following are the links to the edk2 repository:

    https://github.com/tianocore/edk2
    https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/Readme.md
    https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/Maintainers.txt

In general, you should not privately email the maintainer. You should
email the edk2-devel list, and Cc the package maintainers and
reviewers.

If the package maintainer wants to hand over the role to other people,
the package maintainer should send the patch to update Maintainers.txt
with new maintainer, and the new maintainer should follow up with
an Acked-by or a Reviewed-by.

Descriptions of section entries:

  L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area (default is edk2-devel)
     Patches and questions should be sent to the email list.
  M: Package Maintainer: Cc address for patches and questions. Responsible
     for reviewing and pushing package changes to source control.
  R: Package Reviewer: Cc address for patches and questions. Reviewers help
     maintainers review code, but don't have push access. A designated Package
     Reviewer is reasonably familiar with the Package (or some modules
     thereof), and/or provides testing or regression testing for the Package
     (or some modules thereof), in certain platforms and environments.
  W: Web-page with status/info
  T: SCM tree type and location.  Type is one of: git, svn.
  S: Status, one of the following:
     Supported:  Someone is actually paid to look after this.
     Maintained: Someone actually looks after it.
     Odd Fixes:  It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
                 much other than throw the odd patch in. See below.
     Orphan:     No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
                 role as you write your new code].
     Obsolete:   Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
                 it has been replaced by a better system and you
                 should be using that.
